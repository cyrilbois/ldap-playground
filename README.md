The main idea of this playground is to provide an easy to use [LDAP - **L**ightweight **D**irectory **A**ccess **P**rotocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol) server to simply play around with the technology.

> [The Apache Directoryâ„¢ Project](https://directory.apache.org/) - We strive to increase LDAP awareness, comfort and adoption to bring forth what we call the Modern LDAP Renaissance.
